			Bootstrap is a web framework that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The end result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

		</ul>

		<p class="h3">What is Responsive Web Design?</p>

<p class="text-muted">Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.</p>


<p class="h3">
Bootstrap 3 vs. Bootstrap 4</p>
<p class="text-muted">Bootstrap 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness.

Bootstrap 4 supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 9 and down is not supported.</p>





<p class="h3">Why Use Bootstrap?</p>
<p class="h5">Advantages of Bootstrap:</p>

<ul class="text-muted">
	<li>Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap</li>
	<li>Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops</li>
	<li>Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework</li>
	<li>Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 4 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Opera)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h4">Bootstrap 4 CDN</p>
<p class="text-muted">If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>

<p class="text-muted">MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:</p>




<p class="h3">One advantage of using the Bootstrap 4 CDN:</p>

<p class="text-muted">Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
