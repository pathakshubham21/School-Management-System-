			JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.

Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.

	<p class="h3">Example explained:</p>
<ul class="text-muted">
	<li>The HTML document above contains a >p< element with id="p1" >/p<
		<li>We use the HTML DOM to get the element with id="p1"</li>
		<li>A JavaScript changes the content (innerHTML) of that element to "New text!"</li>
		<li>This example changes the content of an >h1< element: >/h1<
</ul>
		
	<p class="h3">DOM Nodes</p>
	<p class="h6">According to the W3C HTML DOM standard, everything in an HTML document is a node:</p>
<p class="text-muted">
The entire document is a document node
Every HTML element is an element node
The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated)
All comments are comment nodes

<p class="text-muted">With the HTML DOM, all nodes in the node tree can be accessed by JavaScript.

New nodes can be created, and all nodes can be modified or deleted.
</p>
</p>



<p class="h3">
Node Relationships
</p>
<p>
The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other.</p>
<p>
The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships.</p>
<ul class="text-muted">
	<li>In a node tree, the top node is called the root (or root node)</li>
	<li>Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)</li>
	<li>A node can have a number of children</li>
	<li>Siblings (brothers or sisters) are nodes with the same parent</li>
</ul>

<p class="h3">
The nodeName Property</p>
<p class="h6">
The nodeName property specifies the name of a node.</p>
<ul class="text-muted">
<li>nodeName is read-only</li>
<li>nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name</li>
<li>nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name</li>
<li>nodeName of a text node is always #text</li>
<li>nodeName of the document node is always #document</li>
</ul>
